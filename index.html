                <p> Çiğ Köfte (pronounced chee-kuhf-teh) is a meatball-like dish popular in Turkey, Armenia, and Arab countries including Lebanon and Syria (where it
                is known as kibbeh niyeh). A type of kofta, or meatball, it is related to kofta found in other cuisines, such as kofta kebab and even malai kofta in north Indian cuisines.
                In Turkey, the dish primarily consists of raw meat, usually lamb or beef, combined with fine bulgur and seasonings. However, meatless versions of çiğ köfte also
                exist, relying on bulgur with a variety of seasonings and flavoring pastes. In fact, a meatless version with bulgur and lentils is traditional in the Armenian Apostolic
                Church during Lent! Since 2008, the Turkish government has banned the sale of raw meat in restaurants, meaning that meatless, or etsiz, çiğ köfte is now the norm. Çiğ köfte
                contains a variety of health benefits, and is bursting with flavor, making it a great addition to your diet. </p>

                <h3 class="origins">Origins</h3>
                <p>While the origin of çiğ köfte is somewhat unclear, what is known is that it emerged in the southwestern part of Turkey. Before the 20th century, this
                region was home to numerous different ethnic groups, including Turks, Kurds, Armenians, Arabs, Assyrians, and Circassians, all of whom were subjects of the Ottoman Empire.
                In the Empire, food traveled easily across what are now modern borders and frontiers. The multiethnic character of Ottoman life also aided in the transmission of food
                across cultures. Different communities in Turkey tell different stories about how çiğ köfte came to be. The common narrative involves:</p>

                <p>A hunter came back to a village one day, bearing a gazelle or deer that he had hunted. Upon arriving home, his wife told him there was no more
                firewood to be had, as the head of the village had banned lighting fires. The hunter, unwilling to lose the benefits of his hunt, ground a portion of the animal up,
                combining the meat with bulgur and spices. In this way, he created the first çiğ köfte.</p>

                <p>In some versions of this account, the lord of the village is replaced with the biblical king Nimrod, who bans fires so as to collect a humongous
                amount of firewood on which to set Abraham alight for his belief in one God.</p>

                <p>Nowadays, different cities in Turkey have different versions of çiğ köfte. Şanlıurfa is most famous for its meat çiğ köfte, and is regarded as the
                home of isot, one of the dish's main ingredients. Adıyaman, not far away, has patented its version of meatless çiğ köfte, and signs advertising "Adıyamanlı çiğ köfte" can
                be found at çiğ köfte restaurants across Turkey in the same way that restaurants in America might advertise "New York-style pizza" or something equivalent. Other
                communities also add egg to the mixture.</p>

                <h3 class="health-benefits">Health Benefits</h3>
                <p>Consuming çiğ köfte has a variety of health benefits. This is down to the wide variety of ingredients used in the making process. The two most
                critical ingredients in this regard are bulgur and isot. Bulgur, which is a type of cracked wheat, is rich in minerals, protein, fiber, and unsaturated fats, when compared
                to other grains. This means it is a great food for those who wish to increase their gut health. It also helps those who want to lose weight, as it makes you feel full and
                keeps you that way. Isot, which is a type of sun-dried pepper native to the Şanlıurfa region of southwestern Turkey, helps aid digestion, and, as a hot spice, can help
                address stuffiness, congestion, and throat issues.</p>
