				<h4 class="note-on-ingredients">Note on Ingredients</h4>
				<p>Some ingredients may be hard to come by. It's essential that you use esmer or çiğ köftelik, also known as brown or dark, bulgur. This
				is a thinner and finer version of the grain than you might see in a bulgur pilaf, which often use yellow bulgur. It's also essential that you have isot and nar ekşisi
				(pomegranate molasses) on hand, as these contain the core flavors of the dish. These two can usually be found at a store selling Turkish-specific products. It's possible
				to find nar ekşisi at Arab stores, but isot is usually only found at Turkish-specific stores. If there isn't one in your area, it's easy to order both items online, either
				through specialty sellers, or even on Amazon.</p>
				<p>When it comes to serving, lavaş bread is traditional. This can be found in many types of stores, and is sort of like a much thinner and
				wider pita bread. This can be exchanged for other types of wrap material, although having a slightly toasty edge, like lavaş does, helps unlock flavors.</p>

				<h2 class="preparation-heading">Preparation</h2>
				<ol class="preparation-list">
					<li>Put the bulgur in a big mixing bowl.</li>
					<li>Heat up the water (do not boil it too much) and pour it over the bulgur. Cover with plastic wrap immediately and let sit for 15 minutes.</li>
					<li>Dice half an onion into small bite-sized pieces (if you're more familiar with french cooking, think of it as slightly smaller than the size of onions in a
					mirepoix).</li>
					<li>At 15 minutes, put your hand in the enlivened bulgur and see if you can start to form it into shapes (it's ok if it comes apart easily at this point, as long as it
					somewhat holds together and doesn't just slip through your fingers).</li>
					<li>Begin to add the ingredients. There's no set order here, but I like to do things in this general order:
						<ul class="ingredients-order">
							<li>Onion</li>
							<li>Grainy seasonings (isot + salt)</li>
							<li>Oil</li>
							<li>Pastes (tomato + pepper)</li>
							<li>Lemon juice</li>
							<li>Nar ekşisi</li>
							<li>Any additional ingredients (smoked paprika, chopped parsley)</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Mix each ingredient in for 3 minutes each. You should notice the color and consistency of the mixture change. It should start to get easier to handle and more
					fragrant as time goes on.</li>
					<li>Once you've mixed all the ingredients in, it's ready to serve!</li>
				</ol>
				<h3 class="serving-heading">To Serve</h3>
				<ol class="serving-list">
					<li>Make shapes with your hands - traditional çiğ köfte looks like a ball with ridges left by finger impressions.</li>
					<li>Decide how you want to serve - consider a lettuce wrap, where you put the köfte inside a leaf of lettuce, and drizzle over nar ekşisi and any other additions you
					want, or a full lavaş wrap, where you can add ingredients like parsley, pickles, and other vegetables for a healthy snack! Or, if you're feeling adventurous, follow
					Kommagene, and add doritos!</li>
					<li>If you're making a wrap, put the çiğ köfte in first, and add other ingredients later. Drizzle nar ekşisi on last.</li>
